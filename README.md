# Student Scorekeeper
A command line program that teachers can use to store and modify student IDs and student scores in a text file.

## Motivation
The student scorekeeper program was an opportunity to learn more about how to use structures, learn to write code that interfaces with the command line, and learn how to read and write to files in C. This program was an improvement on an earlier program that relied on storing structure records to memory, which were erased after the program was closed.
